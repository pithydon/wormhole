To make custom wormhole add the destination of wormhole to "wormholes.txt" in your world folder.

Format for "wormholes.txt" is one position per line.

A position is in "x,y,z" format.

Make textures with the following names.
  "wormhole_t_x_y_z.png"
  "wormhole_b_x_y_z.png"
  "wormhole_e_x_y_z.png"
  "wormhole_w_x_y_z.png"
  "wormhole_n_x_y_z.png"
  "wormhole_s_x_y_z.png"

Replace x, y, and z in name with x, y, and z from destination.

In texture name "t" stands for top, "b" for bottom, "e" for east, "w" for west, "n" for north, and "s" for south.
